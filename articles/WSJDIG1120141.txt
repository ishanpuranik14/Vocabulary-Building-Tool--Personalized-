["Snapchat, a company that has made a name for itself by offering people a way to send very private correspondence, has suffered a very public leak of its users\u2019 information", " And there doesn\u2019t appear to be much that users can do about it", "On Tuesday night, a hacker published a database reportedly containing 4", "6 million Snapchat user names and phone numbers", " The makers of the popular app \u2013 which as of September handled 350 million disappearing messages per day \u2013 did not respond to requests for comment, nor has the company commented on social media channels or elsewhere", "The hacker (or group) going by the name \u201cLightcontact\u201d first posted the database on Reddit and on a website called SnapchatDB", "info", " The site was taken down, but not before the data quickly circulated around the Web, with programmers building web tools \u2013 such as GS Lookup and Snapcheck \u2013 to help Snapchat users check to see if their own user names or phone numbers were leaked", "Many people on social media and around the Web have reported finding their user names and phone numbers in the database", " A Wall Street Journal reporter confirmed that the database is real after spotting his own account information", "Snapchat was warned in August, in a report by a computer security research firm, that its data were vulnerable, said Chris Soghoian, a security and privacy researcher at the American Civil Liberties Union", "After being ignored, Soghoian said, the firm \u2013 Gibson Security \u2013 published a blog post alerting the public about the issue", " \u201cAnd that went ignored too,\u201d Soghoian said", " \u201cThis leak shows you they aren\u2019t handling this correctly", " Granted, they\u2019re much smaller than a Google or Twitter, but they just haven\u2019t invested in security the way that they should", "\u201d\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem to take a lot to figure out how to bypass the protections they have in place,\u201d said Robbie Trencheny, an Oakland app developer who late Tuesday night collaborated with a friend to put together the tool hosted on the GS Lookup page", "Still, this exploit isn\u2019t as bad as it could have been, said author and consumer privacy expert Bob Sullivan", "\u201cThese aren\u2019t credit card numbers and these aren\u2019t social security numbers \u2013 they\u2019re phone numbers,\u201d Sullivan said", " \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst case scenario", " Someone you don\u2019t want to have your number has your number", " This is far from ideal, but not the worst thing that could happen", "\u201dSo what can the people do if their user names and phone numbers have been exposed", " Not much", "\u201cClosing your Snapchat account wouldn\u2019t do any good since the data is pretty much out there,\u201d Sullivan said", " \u201cPeople usually use the same user name across their online accounts, so for many, it would be easy to take a user name and phone number and figure out what a person\u2019s real name is", " If that scares you, then you might want to consider changing your user names across accounts, but that\u2019s about the most you can do now", "\u201dSome services won\u2019t let you change a user name without creating a new account", "To provide context, Sullivan points to the recent credit and debit card leak at Target and the Sony password leaks of 2011", "\u201cOn a scale of 1 to 10, if Target is an 8 and those password leaks are a 9, this is a 2 or 3,\u201d he said", "______________________________________________________\r\nFor the latest news and analysis, follow @wsjd", "\r\n\r\nAnd like us on Facebook to get our news right in your feed:\r\n\r\n\r\nGet breaking news and personal-tech reviews delivered right to your inbox", " \nMore from WSJ", "D: And make sure to visit WSJ", "D for all of our news, personal tech coverage, analysis and more, and add our XML feed to your favorite reader", ""]
